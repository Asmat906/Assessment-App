The above is an assessment task and a small application implementing a modern and scalable MVVM design pattern with Provider for state management. The app is powered by Hive, a lightweight and fast local database, ensuring efficient data handling and offline functionality.

Product Screen: Displays a comprehensive list of products. On selecting an item, the app navigates to the Detail Screen for detailed information.

Detail Screen: Users can add items to the cart or view their cart contents directly.

Cart Screen: Showcases all items added to the cart, with functionality to remove items dynamically.

In this project , I have used the Provider state management, MVVM design Pattern and give database used for cart.
